        <h1>Description</h1>
        
        <p>The bay leaf is an aromatic leaf commonly used in cooking. It can be used whole or in a dried or ground form.
        </p>

        <h1>Culinary and other Uses</h1>
        <p>In Indian cuisine, bay laurel leaves are sometimes used in place of Indian bay leaf although they have a different flavour. They are most often used in rice dishes like biryani and as an ingredient in garam masala. Bay (laurel) leaves are frequently packaged as tezpattā (तेज़पत्ता, the Hindi term for Indian bay leaf) creating confusion between the two herbs.<br><br>

        In the Philippines, dried bay laurel leaves are used in several Filipino dishes such as menudo, beef pares, and adobo.<br><br>
            
        Bay leaves were used for flavouring by the ancient Greeks. They are a fixture in the cooking of many European cuisines (particularly those of the Mediterranean), as well as in the Americas. They are used in soups, stews, brines, meat, seafood, vegetable dishes, and sauces. The leaves also flavour many classic French and Italian dishes. The leaves are most often used whole (sometimes in a bouquet garni) and removed before serving (they can be abrasive in the digestive tract). Thai and Laotian cuisine employs bay leaf (Thai: ใบกระวาน, bai kra wān) in a few Arab-influenced dishes notably massaman curry.
        </p>
        <h1>Medicinal Uses</h1>
        <p>In addition to decorative use, the leaves and oil are used to make medicine. Sweet bay is used to treat gas; stimulate bile flow; and cause sweating. Some people apply sweet bay to the scalp for dandruff. It is also put on the skin for pain, especially muscle and joint pain (rheumatism).
        </p>
        <h1>Cultivation and Harvest</h1>
        <p>Bay leaves can be harvested during the growing season, but if you wish to harvest a bunch at one time, harvest in the midsummer when the leaves are at their peak in terms of essential oils, hence flavor. Simply hand pick or snip off large, unblemished bay leaves for harvest.
