        <h1>Welcome to my Herbs and Spices page</h1>
        <p>I have created this page mainly as a test site while I am learning about HTML, CSS and Javascript but also to share information about herbs and spices. I will be adding some information here mainly to do with the most popular herbs and spices and how they are used in cooking and medicinally. I will also try to add information about cultivating and harvesting. All the information on this site will have been collected from the interweb ... thanks wiki.</p>

        <h2>History of Herbs and Spices</h2>
        <p>One of the most promising developments for spices in modern times is that scientific evidence is accumulating that supports the anecdotal health benefits touted by our ancestors. Research shows that culinary spices and herbs may have beneficial effects in areas such as heart health, cognition, and weight management as well as improving diet quality by making healthier foods more acceptable to consumers. The body of scientific evidence is ever expanding to support the wisdom of our ancestors throughout the ages.</p>
        <p>Writings of Charaka (1st century) and Sushruta II (2nd century) referenced spices and herbs. Sushruta II also used spices and herbs such as cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, turmeric, and pepper for healing purposes. Spices such as cardamom, ginger, black pepper, cumin, and mustard seed were included in ancient herbal medicines for different types of health benefits. In Ayurvedic medicine, spices such as cloves and cardamom were wrapped in betel-nut leaves and chewed after meals to increase the flow of saliva and aid digestion.</p>
