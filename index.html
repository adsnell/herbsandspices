        <h2>History of Herbs and Spices</h2>
        <p>Research shows that culinary spices and herbs may have beneficial effects in areas such as heart health, cognition, and weight management as well as many others. The body of scientific evidence is ever expanding to support the wisdom of our ancestors .</p>
        <p>Writings of Charaka (1st century) and Sushruta II (2nd century) referenced spices and herbs. Sushruta II also used spices and herbs such as cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, turmeric, and pepper for healing purposes. Spices such as cardamom, ginger, black pepper, cumin, and mustard seed were included in ancient herbal medicines for different types of health benefits. In Ayurvedic medicine, spices such as cloves and cardamom were wrapped in betel-nut leaves and chewed after meals to increase the flow of saliva and aid digestion.</p>
